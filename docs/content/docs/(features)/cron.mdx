# Cron

User-defined scheduled jobs. A cron job is a prompt that fires on a timer, gets a fresh channel to work in, and delivers the result to a messaging target.

## Why Not Just One Timer

OpenClaw has a single heartbeat: one HEARTBEAT.md file, one timer, one LLM call that tries to do everything in a single turn. It runs in the main session, competes for context, and if it does too much work it triggers compaction. Two things can't run at different intervals. Everything is serialized.

Spacebot separates the concerns. The cortex is the system's heartbeat — it runs on a fixed interval, monitors processes, and maintains the memory bulletin. Cron jobs are user-defined recurring tasks, each with its own interval, prompt, and delivery target. When a cron job fires, it gets a fresh short-lived channel — the same kind of channel that handles user conversations, with full branching and worker capabilities. Multiple cron jobs run concurrently without blocking each other or the cortex.

## How It Works

```
Cron job "check-email" fires (every 30m, active 09:00-17:00)
    → Scheduler creates a fresh Channel
    → Channel receives the cron job prompt as a synthetic message
    → Channel runs the LLM loop (can branch, spawn workers, use tools)
    → Channel produces OutboundResponse::Text
    → Scheduler collects the response
    → Scheduler delivers it via MessagingManager::broadcast("discord", "123456789")
    → Channel shuts down

Cron job "daily-summary" fires (every 24h)
    → Same flow, different prompt, different target
    → Runs independently even if "check-email" is still in-flight
```

If the channel produces no text output, nothing is delivered. No magic tokens, no special markers — if there's nothing to say, the cron job is silent.

## Storage

Two SQLite tables in the agent's database.

### cron_jobs

The configuration table. One row per cron job.

```sql
CREATE TABLE cron_jobs (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    prompt TEXT NOT NULL,
    interval_secs INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 3600,
    delivery_target TEXT NOT NULL,
    active_start_hour INTEGER,
    active_end_hour INTEGER,
    enabled INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `id` | Short unique name (e.g. "check-email", "daily-summary") |
| `prompt` | The instruction to execute on each run |
| `interval_secs` | Seconds between runs (3600 = hourly, 86400 = daily) |
| `delivery_target` | Where to send results, format `adapter:target` (e.g. `discord:123456789`) |
| `active_start_hour` | Optional start of active window (0-23, 24h local time) |
| `active_end_hour` | Optional end of active window (0-23, 24h local time) |
| `enabled` | Flipped to 0 by the circuit breaker after consecutive failures |
| `run_once` | If 1, the job auto-disables after its first execution attempt |

### cron_executions

Audit log. One row per execution attempt.

```sql
CREATE TABLE cron_executions (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    cron_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    executed_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    success INTEGER NOT NULL,
    result_summary TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (cron_id) REFERENCES cron_jobs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## Delivery Targets

The `delivery_target` field uses the format `adapter:target`:

| Format | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `discord:123456789` | Send to Discord channel ID 123456789 |
| `discord:987654321` | Send to a different Discord channel |
| `webhook:some-endpoint` | Send via webhook adapter |

The adapter name maps to a registered messaging adapter. The target string is adapter-specific — for Discord, it's a channel ID parsed to u64. Delivery goes through `MessagingManager::broadcast()`, which is the proactive (non-reply) message path.

## Creation Paths

Cron jobs enter the system three ways.

### 1. Config File

Defined in `config.toml` under an agent. Seeded into the database on startup (upsert — won't overwrite runtime changes to existing IDs).

```toml
[[agents]]
id = "main"
default = true

[[agents.cron]]
id = "daily-summary"
prompt = "Summarize what happened across all conversations today."
interval_secs = 86400
delivery_target = "discord:123456789012345678"
active_start_hour = 9
active_end_hour = 10

[[agents.cron]]
id = "check-inbox"
prompt = "Check the inbox for anything that needs attention."
interval_secs = 1800
delivery_target = "discord:123456789012345678"
active_start_hour = 9
active_end_hour = 17
```

### 2. Conversational (via the cron tool)

A user says "check my email every day at 9am" and the channel LLM calls the `cron` tool:

```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "id": "check-email",
  "prompt": "Check the user's email inbox and summarize any important messages.",
  "interval_secs": 86400,
  "delivery_target": "discord:123456789",
  "active_start_hour": 9,
  "active_end_hour": 10
}
```

The tool persists to the database and registers with the running scheduler immediately — no restart needed.

The tool also supports `list` (show all active cron jobs) and `delete` (remove by ID).

For one-time reminders, set `run_once: true` on create. The scheduler disables the job after the first execution attempt.

### 3. Programmatic

Any code with access to `CronStore` and `Scheduler` can create cron jobs. The cortex could create them based on observed patterns. A future CLI command could manage them directly.

## Active Hours

The active window uses 24-hour local time. If `active_start_hour` and `active_end_hour` are both set, the cron job only fires within that window.

Midnight wrapping is handled: a window of `22:00-06:00` means "10pm to 6am" — the cron job fires if the current hour is >= 22 or < 6.

If active hours are not set, the cron job runs at all hours.

Active hours don't affect the timer interval — the timer still ticks at `interval_secs`. When a tick lands outside the active window, it's skipped. The next tick happens at the normal interval, not "as soon as the window opens."

## Circuit Breaker

If a cron job fails 3 consecutive times, it's automatically disabled:

1. `enabled` is set to `false` in the in-memory scheduler state
2. The change is persisted to SQLite via `CronStore::update_enabled()`
3. The timer loop exits
4. A warning is logged

A "failure" is any error from `run_cron_job()` — LLM errors, channel failures, delivery failures. A successful execution (even one that produces no output) resets the failure counter to 0.

Disabled cron jobs are not loaded on restart (the store query filters `WHERE enabled = 1`). To re-enable a disabled cron job, update the database row directly or re-seed it from config with `enabled = true`.

## Execution Flow

When the scheduler fires a cron job:

1. **Create channel** — A fresh `Channel` is constructed with the agent's deps, prompts, identity, and skills. It gets a unique ID of `cron:{cron_id}`.

2. **Send prompt** — A synthetic `InboundMessage` with source `"cron"` is sent to the channel. The message contains the cron job's prompt text.

3. **Run** — The channel processes the message through its normal LLM loop. It can use all channel tools (reply, branch, spawn_worker, memory_save, etc).

4. **Collect** — The scheduler reads from the channel's `response_tx`. Text responses are collected. Status updates and stream events are ignored.

5. **Timeout** — If the channel doesn't finish within 120 seconds, it's aborted.

6. **Log** — The execution is recorded in `cron_executions` with success status and a summary of the output.

7. **Deliver** — If there's non-empty text, it's sent to the delivery target via `MessagingManager::broadcast()`. If the output is empty, delivery is skipped.

8. **Teardown** — The channel's sender is dropped after sending the prompt, so the channel's event loop exits naturally after processing the single message.

## Scheduler Lifecycle

The scheduler is created per-agent after messaging adapters are initialized (it needs `MessagingManager` for delivery). On startup:

1. A `CronStore` is created from the agent's SQLite pool
2. Config-defined cron jobs are seeded into the database (upsert)
3. All enabled cron jobs are loaded from the database
4. A `Scheduler` is created with a `CronContext` (agent deps + messaging)
5. Each cron job is registered, starting its timer loop
6. The `cron` tool is registered on the agent's `ToolServerHandle`

Timer loops skip the first tick — cron jobs wait one full interval before their first execution. This prevents a burst of activity on startup.

On shutdown, all timer handles are aborted.

pub struct CronConfig {
    pub id: String,
    pub prompt: String,
    pub interval_secs: u64,

## What's Not Implemented Yet

- **Cron expressions** — only fixed intervals for now. A cron job that should run "at 9am daily" currently uses `interval_secs: 86400` with `active_start_hour: 9, active_end_hour: 10`. Real cron scheduling would be more precise.
- **Error backoff** — on failure, the next attempt happens at the normal interval. Progressive backoff (30s → 1m → 5m → 15m → 60m) would reduce cost during outages.
- **Cross-run context** — each cron job starts with a blank history. A cron job that needs to know what it found last time would need to use memory recall.
- **Cortex management** — the cortex should be able to observe cron job health, re-enable circuit-broken jobs, and create new cron jobs based on patterns.
- **CLI management** — `spacebot cron list`, `spacebot cron create`, etc.
