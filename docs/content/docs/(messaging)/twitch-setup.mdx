# Twitch Setup

Connect Spacebot to Twitch chat. Takes about 5 minutes.

You need a **Twitch account** for the bot and an **OAuth token**.

## Step 1: Create a Twitch Account

Create a Twitch account for your bot (or use an existing one). The bot will send messages as this account.

## Step 2: Get an OAuth Token

Go to [twitchapps.com/tmi](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/) and authorize with the bot account. You'll get a token that looks like `oauth:abc123def456...`.

<Callout type="info">
For production use, you can create a Twitch application at [dev.twitch.tv/console/apps](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps) and generate tokens with the `chat:read` and `chat:edit` scopes via the OAuth flow. The TMI token generator is fine for getting started.
</Callout>

## Step 3: Add Credentials to Spacebot

<Tabs items={["Spacebot UI", "TOML Config"]}>
<Tab value="Spacebot UI">

1. Open your Spacebot dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** → **Messaging Platforms**
3. Click **Setup** on the Twitch card
4. Enter the bot's **username** and **OAuth token**
5. Click **Save**

Spacebot connects immediately — no restart needed.

</Tab>
<Tab value="TOML Config">

```toml
[messaging.twitch]
enabled = true
username = "my_bot"
oauth_token = "oauth:abc123def456..."
channels = ["somechannel", "anotherchannel"]
```

You can also reference environment variables:

```toml
[messaging.twitch]
enabled = true
username = "env:TWITCH_BOT_USERNAME"
oauth_token = "env:TWITCH_OAUTH_TOKEN"
channels = ["somechannel"]
```

Token changes in config require a restart.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Join Channels

Specify which Twitch channels the bot should join. Channel names are case-insensitive and should not include the `#` prefix.

<Tabs items={["Spacebot UI", "TOML Config"]}>
<Tab value="Spacebot UI">

Add channel names in the **Channels** tag input on the Twitch binding form.

</Tab>
<Tab value="TOML Config">

```toml
[messaging.twitch]
channels = ["streamer_name", "another_channel"]
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Verify It's Working

The Twitch card on the Settings page shows a green status dot when connected. Send a message (or a trigger command if you configured one) in a joined channel — you should see the bot reply.

## Trigger Prefix

Twitch channels can be extremely high-volume. By default the bot responds to every message, which is probably not what you want in a busy stream.

Set a trigger prefix so the bot only responds to messages that start with it:

<Tabs items={["Spacebot UI", "TOML Config"]}>
<Tab value="Spacebot UI">

The trigger prefix is configured in the TOML config file.

</Tab>
<Tab value="TOML Config">

```toml
[messaging.twitch]
trigger_prefix = "!ask"
```

With this config, the bot ignores all messages except those starting with `!ask`. The prefix is stripped before processing — if someone types `!ask what is rust?`, the bot sees `what is rust?`.

Set to an empty string or omit to respond to all messages.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Filtering

### Restrict to specific channels

By default the bot responds in every channel it joins. To route specific channels to specific agents, add channel names to your bindings.

<Tabs items={["Spacebot UI", "TOML Config"]}>
<Tab value="Spacebot UI">

Go to **Settings** → **Bindings** tab and add channel names to your Twitch binding.

</Tab>
<Tab value="TOML Config">

```toml
[[bindings]]
agent_id = "main"
channel = "twitch"
channel_ids = ["streamer_name"]
```

If `channel_ids` is empty or omitted, the bot responds in all joined channels.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### User filtering

Restrict which Twitch users can interact with the bot by adding login names to the binding's allowed users list.

<Tabs items={["Spacebot UI", "TOML Config"]}>
<Tab value="Spacebot UI">

Add Twitch usernames to the **DM Allowed Users** list on the binding form.

</Tab>
<Tab value="TOML Config">

```toml
[[bindings]]
agent_id = "main"
channel = "twitch"
dm_allowed_users = ["trusted_user", "another_mod"]
```

When the list is empty (default), all users can interact. Permission changes hot-reload within a couple seconds — no restart needed.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Multiple channels, multiple agents

Route different Twitch channels to different agents.

<Tabs items={["Spacebot UI", "TOML Config"]}>
<Tab value="Spacebot UI">

Create multiple bindings in the **Bindings** tab, each with different channel names and agents.

</Tab>
<Tab value="TOML Config">

```toml
[[bindings]]
agent_id = "main"
channel = "twitch"
channel_ids = ["my_stream"]

[[bindings]]
agent_id = "support-bot"
channel = "twitch"
channel_ids = ["help_channel"]
```

Each agent has its own memory, identity, and conversation history.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Conversations

Each Twitch channel maps to a single conversation (`twitch:<channel_name>`). Unlike Discord or Slack, Twitch chat has no threads — all messages in a channel share one conversation context.

## Limitations

- **No streaming** — Twitch IRC doesn't support message editing, so responses are sent as complete messages rather than streamed word-by-word.
- **Text only** — File attachments are sent as `[File: filename]` text notices since Twitch chat doesn't support media.
- **500 character limit** — Long responses are automatically split into multiple messages.
- **No history backfill** — Twitch IRC doesn't provide message history, so new conversations start fresh.
- **Rate limits** — Twitch limits bots to ~20 messages per 30 seconds (100 if the bot account is a verified bot or moderator in the channel).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `Login authentication failed` | Invalid OAuth token | Generate a fresh token at [twitchapps.com/tmi](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/) |
| Bot connects but doesn't respond | Trigger prefix set | Messages must start with the configured prefix (e.g. `!ask`) |
| Bot responds to everything | No trigger prefix | Set `trigger_prefix` in the config to limit when the bot responds |
| Messages getting dropped | Rate limit | Reduce response frequency or get the bot account verified |
| Bot doesn't join channel | Wrong channel name | Use the login name (lowercase), not the display name |
