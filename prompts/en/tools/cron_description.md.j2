Manage scheduled tasks (cron jobs). Use this to create, list, or delete cron jobs. Prefer `cron_expr` for strict wall-clock schedules; `interval_secs` remains available for legacy interval-based jobs. A cron job runs a prompt and delivers the result to a messaging channel. Use `run_once: true` for one-time reminders; otherwise jobs are recurring.
