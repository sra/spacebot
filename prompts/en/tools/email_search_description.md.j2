Search the configured IMAP mailbox for specific emails and return matching results with metadata and body snippets. Use this when you need to read back what someone said in email, verify details from a previous message, or find messages by sender/subject/topic.

Prefer specific filters (`from`, `subject`, `query`, `since_days`) instead of broad searches. Keep `limit` small unless the user asks for a wider sweep.
