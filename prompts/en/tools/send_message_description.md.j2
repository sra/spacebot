Send a message to a DIFFERENT channel than the one you are currently in. Use this for cross-channel delivery — reminders, notifications, or when the user asks you to post something in another channel or DM them. Do NOT use this to reply in the current conversation — use the `reply` tool for that. Target channels by name or ID from the available channels in your context.
